      <description>Market basket analysis focuses on finding associations between combinations of values in a dataset, using unsupervised algorithms such as apriori algorithm. A key advantage of using this method is the ability to establish relationships by only taking into account the aggregated purchasing patterns of consumers, like sets of receipts.
In essence, the apriori algorithm is a data mining method that tries to identify patterns in the data to create a set of rules such that, given a set of elements, it tries to identify those items that tend to appear when we observe the purchase of another item, or a set of them.</description>
